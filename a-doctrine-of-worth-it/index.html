The feeling is that this sentiment undermines and undervalues the glory of what has been given us today in the deposit of the Holy Spirit, or that we are adopting a defeatist mentality if we acknowledge that this age is supposed to be wrought with difficulty and suffering. I would argue, however, that to neglect a “worth it” doctrine is to misplace the line in the dichotomy between this age and the next,and to misappropriate the powers of the age to come. It is fundamentally, on some level and to some degree, a failure to enter into a particular mode of thinking and living which we ought, scripturally, to adopt. Furthermore, I would suggest that it stems largely from an ill-formed (or nonexistent) theology of suffering.</p><p>But what am I saying?

To sow in faithfulness and hope for much while knowing that this age will never reap the rewards of eternity is one of the most difficult tensions to live in. This seeming paradox is perplexing, indeed, and leaves many running to one extreme or another – saying that the kingdom has in fact come, or that we will experience none of it until the next age.
