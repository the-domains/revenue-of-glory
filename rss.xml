            <title><![CDATA[A Doctrine of “Worth It”]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Doctrine of “Worth It”</h1><p>I know many men of God – some whom I greatly respect and appreciate – who dislike using terminology along the lines of “It’s going to be worth it…”. The feeling is that this sentiment undermines and undervalues the glory of what has been given us today in the deposit of the Holy Spirit, or that we are adopting a defeatist mentality if we acknowledge that this age is supposed to be wrought with difficulty and suffering. I would argue, however, that to neglect a “worth it” doctrine is to misplace the line in the dichotomy between this age and the next,and to misappropriate the powers of the age to come. It is fundamentally, on some level and to some degree, a failure to enter into a particular mode of thinking and living which we ought, scripturally, to adopt. Furthermore, I would suggest that it stems largely from an ill-formed (or nonexistent) theology of suffering.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/be3271929431d91b31a527d06730e406485d5125.jpg"></article>]]></description>
