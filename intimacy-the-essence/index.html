data-reactid="46"><p><strong>“…and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.”</strong>– 1 John 1:3</p><p>I feel that this word “Intimacy” is one that has become quite abstracted through careless use in recent years, and has been relocated from the category of “holy” into that of familiarity through overabundant use. Perhaps we have assigned the word some misplaced sense of sentiment, while we have forgotten nearly altogether what the actual sense of the word ever was in truth. I believe that it’s time to take a step back and reassess the way in which we view and present this word: “Intimacy”.</p><p>I have no desire to substitute another word in its place, for it is a precious word, but I do long to do some unpacking of it so as to revitalize and reclaim from the old and dusty shelf of familiarity. Sometimes I fear that we in our own little corner of the world have used and abused this word to the extent that we have rung it out of all of it’s pure and precious meaning. We’ve left a multitude of people with the idea that they can have such a thing as intimacy cheaply and without much sacrificial cost, while leaving another camp lost in despair that they would never be capable to attain it themselves, all the while claiming that we ourselves – the high and mighty pulpiteers – do have such a thing. The “apostles” of the new age, both genuine and disingenuine, have left a desperately hungry generation, at times, totally unsatisfied, unfed, unhelped, and disillusioned. We have not shepherded this situation over-well.</p><h2>Definition of Intimacy:</h2><h3>Knowledge of God as He Is</h3><p>There is a knowledge of God as He is that is juxtaposed to the cold and clammy gnosis being spewed out of many of the seminaries of our day. This knowledge is of a different kind. It It is familial and familiar. It is transcendent of our categories. It is more in earnest than that of the whitewashed scribe, and more weighty and profound than the young man purporting to have “relationship rather than religion”. It is neither religion over relationship nor the reverse: it is an entrance into an encounter with something so precious that we often cannot define or describe the pathway which led us there. It is unique. And this is because He is unique. He is, in fact, holy.</p><h3>Sway with God (Relational Equity)</h3><p>We have learned through our grecian abstraction skills to make God out to be something other than a person, which ends up lending to our detriment. There is a need to remember that God is not an idea, but a person – with emotions and opinions. Just as we with our fellow man, He desires relationship with the man who is pursuing Him for Him. And this, while it is simple on the tongue, can be difficult to swallow. But the principle applies: there is really such a thing as relational equity when it comes to God. Simply put: those who hold influence with God are those who know Him well, and who appreciate Him for who He is. Moses spoke with the Lord face to face as with a friend – and this led to massive intercessory sway with the Most High.</p><h2>A personal love that does not conflict with, nor negate the corporate. Singularity.</h2><p>I have this principle which I call “singularity of the Bride”. This is not the place nor time to dive into it, but the short is: in our emphasis on the corporate, we can not forget the personal and experiential. This may seem that it is a small point, and/or has no need to be said whatsoever. This, I say mostly to theologians who would relegate everything to a corporate level. For some reason, many in academia love to keep their focus on the forest so much that they forget the trees. Most are in the opposite boat, but some tend toward scrutinizing the macro-storyline to such a point that they forget there are real souls who are players in the drama. May we not make the mistake of veering into a brand of christianity which minimizes the personal and pointed love of Christ for each of us. Dear reader, stop for a moment and ask whether or not the Spirit bears witness with your spirit that He loves you – personally. Do you know that he loves humanity? Good. Can you quote John 3:16? Splendid. Have you sermons on sermons about his love toward humanity? Wonderful. But have you contemplated recently his particular love for your own soul? Maybe this is a good opportunity for just that…</p><h2>Effects of Intimacy</h2><p>True intimacy with God will naturally and necessarily produce an abundance of fruits in us. I would suggest three of the most prevalent to be:</p><p>– Love of Prayer/Communion<br>– Love for the Word<br>– Love of the Brethren</p><p>Simply stated, those who love Him and know Him can not but enjoy spending time with Him. They treasure the scripture as those words directly from Him, and they love all who are His. This is as simple as the first and second commandments having their way in us.</p><p>To all of the above, I would also add “enjoyment”. What is meant, in part, in “loving” these things is: a deep and rich enjoyment of them. The Lord wants not to give us grace to withstand dull and menial disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible — but rather to transform our senses and desires so as to deeply enjoy these. If we truly hold Him as our highest treasure and enjoy Him, we will enjoy these things which bring us near him. We will hang on every word spoken in the eternal Word. We will ache as did Brother Lawrence for any and every small opportunity to commune with our Beloved. We will truly be transformed on such a deep level internally so as to love — with a genuine love — our brothers and sisters. This is not something that is effected aside from the transformative indwelling of the Spirit of Holiness, and by these things we will be known as His disciples. By this we will be perceived as those who have spent time in His council. By this litmus test, our faith shall prove itself genuine. By this we know we are His and that His love abides in us. This is an enjoyable love, indeed.</p><h2>Results of Intimacy</h2><p>The products of true intimacy with the Lord are many. It would be near impossible to even attempt at exhausting the list, but a few are mentioned here.</p><h3>Confidence in Love</h3><p>I have heard it said that the rarest thing on earth is confidence in love, and this, I believe to be true. Perhaps the highest benefit to a saint of that true nearness with the Lord and an intimate knowledge of His character is the precious, calm, and steadfast confidence in His love. Though the storms surge and billows rage around us, we yet have our foundation established deep in this rock. When the Spirit begins to answer that prayer in Ephesians 3 and the heart comes into an experience with that holy love, nothing else can stand before it. When Romans 8 becomes a living and active revelation in the heart, one is invincible from the schemes of Satan and man. This, I would argue, is also the most key thing that the Lord himself is longing to effect in us. For what bridegroom wants his bride to be uncertain or wavering over his own love for her? He would stop at no extreme to ensure that she could rest certain in his unshakable love for her. And so has our Bridegroom done!! Friend, gaze on the Child in the manger! — Gaze on Calvary, and then ask: will He who took on the form of a bondservant and freely laid down His own life for our sakes not freely give us all things? Certainly He will. Meditate on it and pray until it becomes granite in your soul.</p><h3>Confidence in Prayer</h3><p>In addition to the above point, when we have confidence in our relationship with the Ancient of Days, we have confidence that He hears our petitions. When we cry to Him, it is not from a place of begging, but a place of authority. This will be expounded further at another point.</p><h3>Heart After His</h3><p>It was said of David that he had a heart after the Lord’s own heart. We should stop over this and think on the potency of this statement. A man who’s heart was in alignment with the plumb line — who was conformed in congruency with that of the Most High God’s. Here is a man who was, in his thoughts and desires, like unto his King. This should cause two sequential effects in us: the realization that it is possible to know God like this, and the desire that it would be so of us.</p><h3>Zeal for His House</h3><p>As we think upon what it means to have a heart after God’s own heart, let us not neglect the Son of God’s own declaration of being consumed with zeal for His house. Anything that He has zeal for, we ought have a like passion. As the bride draws near to her bridegroom, those things which he cares for most become her cares. Might we seek out earnestly what it means that zeal for His house consumes Him, and seek to enter into an conformity with that passion.</p><h3>Passion for Souls</h3><p>Much work does not need to go into developing a case that the Lamb of God loves and desires the salvation of men. This is the center of the gospel. We ought, however, examine the grounds upon which our love for the souls of other stand. Do we hold a sentimental, humanistic love for others, or do we love first and foremost because He loves? Do we recognize that his passion far outweighs ours? Is our love for men inspired out of intimacy with the Author of our salvation?</p><h3>Passion for Israel</h3><p>Paul makes it clear in Romans 9-11 that our own salvation is not in any way to produce arrogance against the sons of Jacob, for the salvation of the gentiles is not only intrinsically tied to theirs, but is also meant to be a provocation unto them – that they may be saved. Let us learn the heart of the apostle, and more so — let us learn from where it found its source: the Love which Jehovah still has for this precious people.</p><h3>Longing for His Return</h3><p>As one grows nearer Him in friendship, it is inevitable that the ache begin to grow in us to be with Him where He is. The groaning becomes deeper and more pronounced day over day as the veil lying between this age and the next becomes more and more bothersome. Those who know Him and love Him can only long for the day of His appearing. When the Bridegroom is taken away, the friends of the bridegroom fast and mourn.</p><h2>Lastly,</h2><p>It must not be lost in the fray that above all, the value in intimacy is found in the reality that He desires nearness more than we do. It is the joy brought to our Father that is the truest and deepest value of intimacy.</p><p>Let us never, never forget that it was Christ Himself who spoke those holy words “Father, I desire…”. Do you believe that He desires you? Do you feel in your heart that He wants to spend precious hours with you? Certainly, He does, but it takes the Spirit to crack our stony hearts and illuminate this reality… and so let us come to allow Him.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">Intimacy: The Essence</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="57"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
