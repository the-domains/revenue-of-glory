The topic at hand is difficult to address properly, so please bear with me as I give it my best go. These things are on my heart and mind this morning as I think on the nature of apostolic living in the midst of this present age.

I know many men of God -- some whom I greatly respect and appreciate -- who dislike using terminology along the lines of "It's going to be worth it...". The feeling is that this sentiment undermines and undervalues the glory of what has been given us today in the deposit of the Holy Spirit, or that we are adopting a defeatist mentality if we acknowledge that this age is supposed to be wrought with difficulty and suffering. I would argue, however, that to neglect a "worth it" doctrine is to misplace the line in the dichotomy between this age and the next,and to misappropriate the powers of the age to come. It is fundamentally, on some level and to some degree, a failure to enter into a particular mode of thinking and living which we ought, scripturally, to adopt. Furthermore, I would suggest that it stems largely from an ill-formed (or nonexistent) theology of suffering.

But what am I saying? Simply put: if we believe in the full glory of the next age over and above anything we experience now, then necessarily there is a dynamic of waiting and longing and "hanging in there".

And cue almost any Pauline metaphor... running the race so as to win the prize, fighting the good fight, beating the body... persevering as we longingly strive toward the prize which awaits.

It is the wisdom of God to leave us in this tension... seeing dimly, hoping for the fullest manifestation in the present, but not anchoring our hope in it. To sow in faithfulness and hope for much while knowing that this age will never reap the rewards of eternity is one of the most difficult tensions to live in. This seeming paradox is perplexing, indeed, and leaves many running to one extreme or another -- saying that the kingdom has in fact come, or that we will experience none of it until the next age. Neither is proper, however, and we must learn to engage the difficulty of the both/and.

I don't believe that we are left running around in this present darkness like chickens with our heads cut off -- hoping only to scrape by (though some days it would feel like it), but I do believe that we are in no way living for this age, and if we are to live for the next -- to hope for it eagerly -- to watch and wait for His appearing... if we are to anchor our hope in that eternal weight of glory to come (not to be compared with the trials and sufferings we now encounter), then we have to acknowledge a certain lack of glory of the now. We live in a "present evil age", we walk as it were through the night, but the morning is certainly coming.

I will likely post more on this -- fleshing out the scriptural case and exploring some more angles, but for today the purpose of this post is simple: to give confidence and hope to those who are walking through a season where the pain is so strong and the "worth it" so potent, and to challenge those who have not felt the "worth it" in a while to test where their hope lies. Are we yet unsatisfied until the morning star arises? We ought to be.
