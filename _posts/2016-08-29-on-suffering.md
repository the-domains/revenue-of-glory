# On Suffering.

We do the gospel and the hope of men a disservice when we present a distorted and faulty variation of the gospel devoid of the assurance of present suffering.

What do I mean?

All can attest that suffering is part of our lot. It is a part of the human experience. None would object to the presence of suffering and trouble. Where we divide our factions is over the categories and reasonings through which we seek to explain and address that suffering.

If we strip suffering from the gospel and give a man the hope of living without pain in this life, we give him a faulty hope. For that is not the experience of any. If I tell you that God is altogether sovereign and all powerful (as most who call themselves Christians affirm), and I, in the same breath, tell you that God always and only acts in your personal and present best interest, then I have presented to you a god who is not very much a god at all, for the simplest fool would point out that his experience does not match up with this proposition.

This is why years ago I sat stunned and without an answer when, after an attempted debate, a philosophy professor left me dumbfounded and humiliated over this premise: "God cannot be omnipotent and omni-benevolent."

I did what I could to defend my God, but came up terribly short as the doctor's argument seemed to win out on every side. Though I never lost faith, the question was left ringing in my ear for years to come as I wrestled through the issue, and came at last to the simplest, yet most profound realization:

Suffering is about love. Without suffering, there would be no opportunity for the manifestation nor demonstration of love.

Which is, I believe, the connection being drawn so frequently in the epistles between faith, hope, and love. It's unspoken, but it flows like spring water between the lines. Suffering and pain are the chords which bind faith, hope, and love.

Our faith in God flows from and is strengthened by love for God, producing hope in the fulfillment of the promises of God. This bright hope is only hope when contrasted with the present darkness. Furthermore, the opportunity to choose to step forward through muck and mire with praise on the lips is only a response stemming from faith working through love.

The promises of God are to bring us at last to the golden shores of an age in which, truly, every tear will be wiped away and suffering as we know it will be nothing but a distant memory. But that very suffering will be the bedrock and foundation of the self-same love which will endure through the ages. Without it, our love itself is... not very much love at all.

The cynic and the self-righteous long to see the realization of that golden age on their own timeline and their own terms, and they come up with various solutions to the problem that is suffering --- ranging from a diminishment of the character of God, a dissolution of Him altogether, or a distortion of His motives and/or plans.

But God will only have this story culminated and the age consummated on His terms, and His terms involve something that the enemy cannot undermine because he cannot understand it: love.

Only a gospel of suffering before glory can at the same time vindicate God's power and goodness as well as man's experience with no conflict. We have truly, and very to our detriment, truly mistaken some financial success, affluence, and improvement of quality of life and temporal ease in the western world for the post-millennial increase of some invisible golden kingdom, thereby misappropriating our hope and getting ourselves wrongly anchored in a faith that is not very much faith at all, and a hope that is no more real. And the love we have... well, I would implore us to at least ask the question: is it love of money and ease, or love of God?

How we respond to the trials and sufferings of this age might just help us to more easily answer that question.. and though many of us will find our heart's treasure in a proper place, some may be sadly surprised at the result.

### MY FINAL DISCLAIMER...

This note is at the risk, to some degree, of being called out as pretentious, pompous, perhaps even artificial or naive. I don't want to give the impression that I am one who has enough experience with suffering and pain to make myself an authority in the teaching on it. My life has been characterized by tremendous ease and joy --- on a level that is nearly uncomfortable sometimes. What becomes difficult to wrestle with is the relative ease of your life when you witness, or even just distantly hear tell of the intensity of suffering in the lives of others.

I do not exalt myself to the place of judge in these matters, for the Lord knows. All I desire is to give voice to the fact that the Bible's pages do not allow me to make myself greater than the man with much suffering, nor him exalted above I, but rather leaves both of us subject to the cross. And the degree to which each of us looks up to Jesus in the midst of the respective fortune or famine in our lives is the degree to which we have found true good.
