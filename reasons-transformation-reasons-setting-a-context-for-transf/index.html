Let it not be thought that I am making a claim for this as the only method to transformation of the heart, but I can say that after over a decade of ministry experience, it is certainly the most effective methodology I have seen. Take a weak and broken man or woman, and place them — for four or six hours every day — in a room with Jesus-exalting and scripture-centered music, give them a bible, and let them be… then watch and wait to see what happens.</p><p>Can someone stay in this environment for even a few months without something seriously fierce happening deep within them? Well, certainly, as I have seen – it is possible to exist in this environment and not be transformed – but you have to truly be kicking against the goads, and, I believe, this is really still your best opportunity for transformation. For what other environment is as perfect for the impacting of the heart unto lasting change?</p><p>This is unique. Part of the beauty of this little neo-monastic expression of ministry is the simple power of sitting still before Him, and allowing the mind to be washed with the water of the word. Reading slowly and reading long through the scriptures… listing to the words and truths of scripture being sung… praying, meditating, waiting. I can not overemphasize how powerful this is — and, in fact, necessary in an age when the powers of darkness are not only raging, but have quite an upper hand in the arena of indoctrination.</p><p>(Eph. 2:1-3, 2 Cor. 4:4, 2 Cor. 10:3-5, Eph. 6:11-12, etc.)</p><h2>Intentional & Purposeful Self-Indoctrination.</h2><p>We are constantly being indoctrinated. Whether we like it or not, and whether or not we acknowledge it, we are always having some message bearing in upon the fortress of our minds. After time, the messages we are saturated with win out and break down the barricades. Marketers know this well. It is said that it takes an average of seven repetitions of an advertisement message to produce a purchase decision.</p><p>While everything in my culture is waging war against the knowledge of God and the truths of scripture, I need to be massively purposeful and intentional in my defense against this. And the best method I have found is the renewing of the mind. And the best option I have found is the choice available to me to spend several hours every day in this room where the truth of God is blasted at me — allowing truth to soak into my mind rather than filth.</p><p>I am decidedly indoctrinating myself. But the key here is my intentional choice of the message. I am not waiting for society to pick out my heart’s meditations of the day, but rather I am isolating myself with only those truths spoken by God. This is how a young man can keep his way pure.</p><p>(Ps. 19:7-14, Ps. 119:9-10, Phil. 4:8, Col. 3:1-2, etc.)</p><h2>Not Overly Extravagant</h2><p>There is a common perspective that I run into that what we do here is extremely extravagant and consumes an overwhelming (and, many believe unnecessary or wasteful) amount of time. But allow me to paint it in this light: at present, I spend something like four to six hours per day in the prayer room — most mornings of the week. This is the same amount of time that many spend in their workout regime. If it is worthwhile and perfectly acceptable to take hours of the day for strengthening the body in a gym, is not the same true — and all the more so — of the value, in fact need, to strengthen the soul?</p><p>To utilize a grim and saddening comparison, this is the same amount of time that many grown men spend in playing video games per day. Oh, is He not worth this time being allocated to Him? Are our eternal states not worth it? Is our sanctification not important enough to carve out a serious amount of time dedicated to it?</p><p>I have in me the compelling desire to call my peers to a lifestyle of serious devotion, which is really only a reasonable response to the cultural context within which we live.</p><h2>It Does Require Time</h2><p>The transformation does not occur overnight. One week in the prayer room can be impactful, but what is needed is giving yourself to this as a lifestyle over years. Just as a week of eating well and spending time at the gym is not overly helpful in the long run for health, so it takes dedication and longevity to see the desired results of a lifestyle of prayer.</p><p>But… if one will give this a try, and dedicate some significant amounts of time to sitting before Him, they will find the heart changed. I have seen this story over and again, and it remains one of the most potent joys in doing what I do. As we labor to strengthen and establish night and day prayer across the earth, I keep in view a portrait of numerous lives transformed entirely by the potency of immersion in an incubator where truth thrives.</p><picture>
